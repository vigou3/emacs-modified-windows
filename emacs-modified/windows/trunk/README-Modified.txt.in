This is the official release of GNU Emacs for Windows modified to
include the following add-on packages:

* ESS <ESSVERSION>;
* AUCTeX <AUCTEXVERSION>;
* org <ORGVERSION>;
* polymode <POLYMODEVERSION> and markdown-mode <MARKDOWNMODEVERSION>;
* psvn.el r<PSVNVERSION> from Subversion sources, to work with
  Subversion repositories from within Emacs;
* Aspell 0.50.3, a spell checked well integrated with Emacs;
* English (version 0.50-2-3), French (version 0.50-3-3), German
  (version 0.50-2-3) and Spanish (version 0.50-2-3) dictionnaries for
  Aspell;
* Libraries for image formats PNG (<LIBPNGVERSION>, <LIBZLIBVERSION>),
  JPEG (<LIBJPEGVERSION>), TIFF (<LIBTIFFVERSION>) and GIF (<LIBGIFVERSION>) obtained
  from the ezwinports project.
* GnuTLS libraries from the ezwinports project (<LIBGNUTLSVERSION>) to
  allow Emacs to access web sites using https on Windows.
* w32-winprint.el, to ease printing on Windows;
* htmlize.el, to print in color with w32-winprint.el;
* framepop.el, to obtain temporary buffers in separate frames;
* site-start.el, to make everything work.

Note that polymode is made active for R mode by default.


To add Emacs extensions to this distribution, simply drop .el files
into the ...\share\emacs\site-lisp\site-start.d\ folder.

See http://aspell.net/win32/ to install other dictionnaries for Aspell.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/ to install other Unix
applications sometimes required by Emacs (e.g. diff, gzip).

preview-latex requires an installation of Ghostscript
(http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/). Make sure the file gswin32c.exe is
somewhere in the PATH environment variable.

If it did not already exist, an environment variable HOME was created
during installation. This variable is required by Emacs and, thus,
should not be removed. The HOME folder will be the default work folder
of Emacs.
