=== Emacs for Windows Modified ===

* If R is not installed in the usual (default) location, it may be
  necessary to edit the paths in the site configuration file for ESS
  to find the R executable. This should also be true for any S+
  installation. The site configuration file is accessed easily using
  the shortcut in the GNU Emacs program group of the Start menu.

* To add Emacs extensions to this distribution, simply drop .el
  files into the ...\site-lisp\site-start.d\ folder.

* See http://aspell.net/win32/ to install other dictionnaries for Aspell.

* See http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ to install other Unix applications
  sometimes required by Emacs (e.g. diff, gzip).

* preview-latex requires an installation of Ghostscript
  (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/). Make sure the file gswin32c.exe is
  somewhere in the PATH environment variable; see below.

* If it did not already exist, an environment variable HOME was created
  during installation. This variable is required by Emacs and, thus, should
  not be removed. The HOME folder will be the default work folder of Emacs.

* To change the value of an environment variable (Windows XP): right-click
  on My Computer, choose Properties, then the Advanced tab and press the
  Environment variables button; select the user variable (e.g. HOME or
  PATH) and press Modify; make the change and close all the windows by
  pressing Ok.

The information above is available in file Updates-en.txt in the Emacs
installation folder.
