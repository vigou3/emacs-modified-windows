;;; ESS

;; Following the "source is real" philosophy put forward by ESS, one
;; should not need the command history and should not save the
;; workspace at the end of an R session. Hence, both options are
;; disabled here.

;; Automagically delete trailing whitespace when saving R script
;; files. One can add other commands in the ess-mode-hook below.

;; commit changes, revert files, etc., all within Emacs.
