    (require 'w32-winprint)

  in the system-wide configuration file site-start.el.

  the color toolbar and preview-latex (with an installation of
  Ghostscript). Libraries obtained from the GnuWin32 project.

o By default, M-x R will now start R with the --no-restore-history and

  minibuffer at R startup about a non-existing history file; with the
  second option R exits gracefully if killed by Emacs shutdown.
o Code indentation for *.R buffers now follows the R convention: BSD
  style with an offset of 4 characters.
