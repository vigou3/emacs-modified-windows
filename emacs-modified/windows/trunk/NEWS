=== GNU Emacs for Windows Modified ===

Version 23.4-modified-1-i386 (26 February 2012)
===============================================

NEW FEATURE

o An up-to-date version of org-mode is now included with the
  distribution. As of this release, this is version 7.8.03 of
  org-mode.

(APPARENTLY) USER VISIBLE CHANGE

o File site-start.el is reinstated in the distribution. Loading of
  extension packages is still done in default.el, but customizations
  that I provide [that is, the (setq ..)] are located in
  site-start.el.

UPDATE

o psvn.el updated to version of 2012-02-21.


Version 23.4-modified-1 (6 February 2012)
=========================================

NEW FEATURE

o AppId now set to GNU Emacs version (e.g. 23.4) in Inno Setup. This
  way, the installer will stop using an older version's (e.g. 23.3)
  installation directory as default when said previous version was not
  uninstalled. See http://www.jrsoftware.org/isfaq.php#olddir for
  details.

UPDATE

o GNU Emacs 23.4 released January 29, 2012. ESS and AUCTeX are still at
  version 5.14 and 11.86patched, respectively.


Version 23.3-modified-3 (20 August 2011)
========================================

(MORE OR LESS) USER VISIBLE CHANGE

o File site-start.el renamed to default.el. Therefore, package loading
  and Emacs configuration now happens *after* any user and site
  configuration file is read. The distribution should now behave
  better with users' settings. Thanks to Rodney Sparapani
  <rsparapa@mcw.edu> and Stephen Eglen <S.J.Eglen@damtp.cam.ac.uk> for
  pointers on this issue.


Version 23.3-modified-2 (9 August 2011)
=======================================

UPDATES

o ESS version 5.14.

o Image libraries libpng and zlib1 updated (to 1.4.3 and 1.2.5,
  respectively) to solve a docview-mode problem with
  AUCTeX. Up-to-date binaries taken from http://gtk.org. Many thanks
  to Hans Olav Husum <hohusum@gmail.com> for reporting both the
  problem and the solution.

o AUCTEX 11.86 patched to have version 1.286 of preview.el. This
  solves image creation issues as explained here:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=646632
  More thanks to Hans Olav Husum <hohusum@gmail.com> for reporting the
  problem with a solution.

================================================

  in the system-wide configuration file site-start.el.

o By default, M-x R will now start R with the --no-restore-history and

  minibuffer at R startup about a non-existing history file; with the
  second option R exits gracefully if killed by Emacs shutdown.
o Code indentation for *.R buffers now follows the R convention: BSD
  style with an offset of 4 characters.
