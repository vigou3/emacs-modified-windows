Version 22.1-modified-1 (30 August 2007)
========================================

NEW FEATURES

o Introduction of a version number
o Introduction of this NEWS file
o By default, M-x R will now start R with the --no-restore-history and
  --no-save options. The first option avoids getting a warning in the
  minibuffer at R startup about a non-existing history file; with the
  second option R exits gracefully if killed by Emacs shutdown.
o Code indentation for *.R buffers now follows the R convention: BSD
  style with an offset of 4 characters.
