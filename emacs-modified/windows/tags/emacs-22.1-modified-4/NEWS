=== Modified version of GNU Emacs for Windows ===

Version 22.1-modified-4 (12 December 2007)
==========================================

BUG FIX

o The w32-winprint.el package was not activated in the site-start.el
  file, so the promise of simpler printing was not fulfilled. This is
  a simple fix that does not require a complete new download: add 

    ;;; Activate w32-winprint
    (require 'w32-winprint)

  in the system-wide configuration file site-start.el.


Version 22.1-modified-3 (19 November 2007)
==========================================

NEW FEATURES

o Libraries for image formats XPM (xpm4.dll), PNG (libpng13.dll,
  zlib1.dll), JPEG (jpeg62.dll), TIFF (libtiff3.dll) and GIF
  giflib4.dll) now included in the distribution. This gives access to
  the color toolbar and preview-latex (with an installation of
  Ghostscript). Libraries obtained from the GnuWin32 project.


Version 22.1-modified-2 (19 September 2007)
===========================================

UPDATES

o ESS updated to version 5.3.6.


Version 22.1-modified-1 (30 August 2007)
========================================

NEW FEATURES

o Introduction of a version number
o Introduction of this NEWS file
o By default, M-x R will now start R with the --no-restore-history and
  --no-save options. The first option avoids getting a warning in the
  minibuffer at R startup about a non-existing history file; with the
  second option R exits gracefully if killed by Emacs shutdown.
o Code indentation for *.R buffers now follows the R convention: BSD
  style with an offset of 4 characters.
