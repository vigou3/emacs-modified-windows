  * If R is not installed in the usual (default) location, it may be
    necessary to edit the paths in the site configuration file for ESS
    to find the R executable. This should also be true for any S-Plus
    installation. The site configuration file is accessed easily using
    the shortcut in the GNU Emacs program group of the Start menu.

  * See http://aspell.net/win32/ to install other dictionnaries for
    Aspell.

  * See http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ to install other Unix
    applications sometimes required by Emacs (e.g. diff, gzip).

  * If it did not already exist, an environment variable HOME was
    created during installation. This variable is required by Emacs
    and, thus, should not be removed. The HOME folder will be the
    default work folder of Emacs. To change the value of the variable
    (Windows XP): right-click on My Computer, choose Properties, then
    the Advanced tab and press the Environment variables button;
    select the HOME user variable and press Modify; enter the name of
    the desired folder and close all the windows by pressing Ok.

The information above is available in file Updates-en.txt in the
Emacs installation folder.
