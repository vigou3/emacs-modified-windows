# VERSION 26.1-modified-2 (19 June 2018)

## Bug fix

Aspell did not work in the previous release as Emacs 26.1 requires a
version >= 0.60 for which there is no binary version for Windows (see
https://github.com/vigou3/emacs-modified-windows/issues/7 for
additional detail).

As a replacement, the distribution now ships with Hunspell with the
latest English, French, German and Spanish dictionaries.

# VERSION 26.1-modified-1 (31 May 2018)

## Updates

- Emacs 26.1 released 28 May 2018. This is the official GNU build with
  the optional dependency libraries as it appears the maintainer of
  the emacs-w64 project does not intend to build a version for 26.1.
- Org 9.1.13

# VERSION 25.3-modified-2 (18 January 2018)

## Updates

- AUCTeX 12.1

- Org 9.1.3
- markdownmode.el v2.3


# VERSION 25.2-modified-3 (2 June 2017)

## New features

**GNU Emacs is now the 64-bit (x64) version.**

The distribution is now based on the release version of emacs-w64
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/), a native 64-bit
distribution of GNU Emacs for Windows compiled with optimization and
providing support for PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF and SVG images, XML2 and
GnuTLS.

## Updates

- Org 9.0.7
- polymode 2017-03-07
- markdownmode.el v2.2

## Other user visible changes

Long outdated w32-winprint.el and htmlize.el removed from the distribution.


# VERSION 25.2-modified-2 (5 May 2017)

## Bug fix

- JPEG image support fixed. The distribution now ships with
  `libjpeg-8.dll` as this is the version Emacs was compiled
  against. Thanks to GitHub user sylvest99js for the heads up.

# VERSION 25.2-modified-1 (4 May 2017)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 25.2, released April 21, 2017.
- Org 9.0.6

## User visible changes

- In `site-start.el`, `ess-nuke-trailing-whitespace` is now added to
  the `write-contents-functions` hook to avoid bleeding of the
  functionality to other major modes (most notably markdown, where
  trailing whitespace is sometimes useful).

# VERSION 25.1-2-modified-5 (11 January 2016)

## Updates

- AUCTeX 11.90

# VERSION 25.1-2-modified-4 (9 January 2016)

## Updates

- Org 9.0.3

# VERSION 25.1-2-modified-3 (15 December 2016)

## New feature

- Experimental support for SVG images by means of
  librsvg-2.2.dll. Please report any problems (or success!).

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 25.1-2, released November 29, 2016. This Windows-only
  patch release fixes impaired performance in the previous release due
  to missing optimization flags at build time. Thanks to Max Sutton
  <max.sutton.is@gmail.com> for the heads up.
- Org 9.0.2
- gnutls-3.4.15 providing libgnutls-30.dll as required by Emacs
  25.1. Thanks again to Max Sutton <max.sutton.is@gmail.com> for
  pointing this out.

## Bug fix

- `emacs-modified-version` now correctly report the Emacs patch level.

# VERSION 25.1-modified-2 (24 October 2016)

# VERSION 25.1-modified-1 (19 September 2016)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 25.1, released September 17, 2016.
- Org 8.3.6

# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-9 (15 July 2016)

## User VISIBLE CHANGES

- The default configuration has changed as follows:
  ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX is active for Sweave documents using the
  AUCTeX interface; polymode is active only for Rmarkdown (and as a
  by-product for R help files). See threads in the ess-help mailing
  list in April and July 2016 for some rationale for this decision
  (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/). With this update the
  Windows version of the distribution is now in line with the macOS
  version.

# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-8 (20 June 2016)

## Bug fix

- Additional image libraries were missing from the previous
  release. Thanks to David Braze <dave.braze@yale.edu> for the heads
  up.

# VERSION 24.4-modified-4 (26 April 2015)

## Updates

## User visible changes

- As per an AUCTeX maintainer's recommendation, packages initialisation
  has been moved back from default.el to site-start.el. Please report
  if this causes any problem.

  Config file default.el now only contains invocations for this
  distribution's custom package `version-modified.el`.

# VERSION 24.4-modified-3 (1 April 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.03
- Org 8.3.1

# VERSION 24.4-modified-2 (2 February 2015)

## Updates

- AUCTeX 11.88

  using https; see

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17219643/cant-install-emacs-el-get-package-emacs-cant-connect-to-the-internet

  for a rationale. Thanks to Emiliano Heyns <emiliano.heyns@iris-advies.com>
  for the suggestion.

## User visible changes

- The distribution version string is now included in the
  README-Modified.txt file.

## Bug fixes

- The site-start.d directory was incorrectly located in the previous
  release.
- Files were inadvertently left in the installation directory.

# VERSION 24.4-modified-1 (16 November 2014)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 24.4 released October 20, 2014.
- org 8.2.10

## User visible changes

- The icon provided in the program group to edit the site
  configuration file has been deleted. It no longer served any good
  purpose now that ESS is able to locate all (sensibly located)
  versions of R on the system.
- The directory structure in the Emacs installation directory changed
  significantly upstream. Most files are now located in the
  ...\share\emacs directory.
- Due to difficulty building the Org manuals on Windows, the PDF
  manual has been replaced in the distribution by the HTML version.

# VERSION 24.3-modified-5 (14 September 2014)

## New features

- polymode and markdown-mode are now included in the distribution. By
  default, polymode is active for R mode and automaically loaded for
  the following file extensions: .Snw, .Rnw, .Rmd, .rapport, .Rhtml,
  .Rbrew, .Rcpp, .cppR.
- org mode (latest stable release at build time) is reintroduced in
  the distribution.
- All .el files (except configuration files default.el and
  site-start.el) are now also distributed byte-compiled.

## Updates

- ESS 14.09
- org 8.2.7c

## User visible changes

- Streamlined installation procedure: no more information screens at
  the beginning and end of the setup wizard. These have been replaced
  by an option to see the README-Modified file containing the
  inforation that was formerly displayed.
- Configuration of Emacs for MIKTeX is now an option in the setup
  wizard (it was done by default before).

# VERSION 24.3-modified-4 (8 December 2013)

## New feature

- Function and variable `emacs-modified-version` to display and hold
  the distribution version number.

## Bug fix

- Inno Setup installer's AppId key was not correctly updated between
  versions.

## Updates

- ESS 13.09-1

# VERSION 24.3-modified-3 (27 September 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 13.09

# VERSION 24.3-modified-2 (15 May 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 13.05

## (More or less) User visible changes

- In site-start.el, `inferior-R-args` no longer includes
  "--no-restore-history" as it apparently had no effect. Thanks to
  Vitalie Spinu for the rectification.
- In site-start.el, `ess-default-style` is no longer defined to be
  "C++" since the default indentation style in ESS is now "RRR".

# VERSION 24.3-modified-1 (19 March 2013)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 24.3, released on March 11 but only today in Windows
  binary form.

# VERSION 24.2-modified-7 (23 January 2013)

## Bug fix

- Fixed the startup warning message about org-install being
  deprecated. Unfinished job in previous release.

# VERSION 24.2-modified-6 (18 January 2013)

## User visible change

- Org is *removed* from the distribution as it triggered a warning
  message at Emacs startup. This may seem a rather drastic measure,
  but Org has proved annoying to support as an add-on to the
  distribution. The package may be installed via the Emacs package
  system; see http://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html. The version
  of Org shipping with GNU Emacs 24.2 is 7.8.11.

## Bug fix

- For some reason, addpm.exe was left off the distribution.

# VERSION 24.2-modified-5 (12 January 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 12.09-2
- Org 7.9.3c
- psvn.el is now revision 1369093 of Subversion source code repository
  with Andre Colomb's and Koji Nakamaru's patches to support
  Subversion 1.7; see
  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox//subversion-dev/201208.mbox/%3C503B958F.6010906@schickhardt.org%3E
  The original file appears to actually be *older* than Stefan
  Reichoer's version of 2012-03-26 in some respect, but using the
  Subversion sources version made it easier to apply the patches.

# VERSION 24.2-modified-4 (22 December 2012)

## Update

- ESS 12-09-1

# VERSION 24.2-modified-3 (8 December 2012)

# VERSION 24.2-modified-2 (24 September 2012)

## Updates

## Updates

- ESS 12.04-2
- Org 7.8.09
- psvn.el modified to include Koji Nakamaru's patch
  (http://www.eaflux.com/psvn/psvn.el.diff) for supporting Subversion
  1.7.

# VERSION 23.4-modified-4 (6 April 2012)

## Updates

- ESS 12.04
- Org 7.8.08

## Bug fix

- Org was not correctly installed in previous version due to org's
  akward use of environment variable DESTDIR in its Makefile.

# VERSION 23.4-modified-3 (1 April 2012 - No April's Fool!)

## Updates

- ESS 12.03
- Org 7.8.07

## New feature

- Added vc-svn17.el to provide Subversion 1.7 support for vc-svn on
  Emacs 23.

# VERSION 23.4-modified-2 (26 February 2012)

## New feature

- An up-to-date version of org-mode is now included with the
  distribution. As of this release, this is version 7.8.03 of
  org-mode.

## (Apparently) User visible change

- File site-start.el is reinstated in the distribution. Loading of
  extension packages is still done in default.el, but customizations
  that I provide [that is, the (setq ..)] are located in
  site-start.el.

## Update

- psvn.el updated to version of 2012-02-21.

# VERSION 23.4-modified-1 (6 February 2012)

## New feature

- AppId now set to GNU Emacs version (e.g. 23.4) in Inno Setup. This
  way, the installer will stop using an older version's (e.g. 23.3)
  installation directory as default when said previous version was not
  uninstalled. See http://www.jrsoftware.org/isfaq.php#olddir for
  details.

## Update

- GNU Emacs 23.4 released January 29, 2012. ESS and AUCTeX are still at
  version 5.14 and 11.86patched, respectively.

# VERSION 23.3-modified-3 (20 August 2011)

## (More or less) User visible change

- File site-start.el renamed to default.el. Therefore, package loading
  and Emacs configuration now happens *after* any user and site
  configuration file is read. The distribution should now behave
  better with users' settings. Thanks to Rodney Sparapani
  <rsparapa@mcw.edu> and Stephen Eglen <S.J.Eglen@damtp.cam.ac.uk> for
  pointers on this issue.

# VERSION 23.3-modified-2 (9 August 2011)

## Updates

- ESS version 5.14.
- Image libraries libpng and zlib1 updated (to 1.4.3 and 1.2.5,
  respectively) to solve a docview-mode problem with
  AUCTeX. Up-to-date binaries taken from http://gtk.org. Many thanks
  to Hans Olav Husum <hohusum@gmail.com> for reporting both the
  problem and the solution.
- AUCTEX 11.86 patched to have version 1.286 of preview.el. This
  solves image creation issues as explained here:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=646632
  More thanks to Hans Olav Husum <hohusum@gmail.com> for reporting the
  problem with a solution.

# VERSION 23.3-modified-1 (23 March 2011)

## Update

## Bug fix

## Bug fix

- Less invasive definition of the ESS indentation style in
  site-start.el. Follows from a thread in ess-help starting here:

## New features

- AUCTeX version 11.85.
- Distribution now includes htmlize-view.el (from the EmacsW32
  project) to add a Quick print in color menu entry.

# VERSION 22.1-modified-4 (12 December 2007)

## Bug fix

- The w32-winprint.el package was not activated in the site-start.el
  file, so the promise of simpler printing was not fulfilled. This is
  a simple fix that does not require a complete new download: add

    ;;; Activate w32-winprint
    (require 'w32-winprint)

  in the system-wide configuration file site-start.el.

# VERSION 22.1-modified-2 (19 September 2007)

## Updates

- ESS updated to version 5.3.6.

# VERSION 22.1-modified-1 (30 August 2007)

## New features

- Introduction of a version number
- Introduction of this NEWS file
- By default, M-x R will now start R with the --no-restore-history and
  --no-save options. The first option avoids getting a warning in the
  minibuffer at R startup about a non-existing history file; with the
  second option R exits gracefully if killed by Emacs shutdown.
- Code indentation for *.R buffers now follows the R convention: BSD
  style with an offset of 4 characters.
